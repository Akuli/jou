# If an imported file has a main() function, it is ignored.
#
# This is useful in large Jou projects. For example, large_project/json_utils.jou
# could have a main function for experimenting with JSON files, and
# large_project/main.jou can simply import it.

import "./public_hello_printer.jou"

def main() -> int:
    # Call it twice to make sure compiler doesn't run the other main function
    print_hello()  # Output: Hello World!
    print_hello()  # Output: Hello World!
    return 0
