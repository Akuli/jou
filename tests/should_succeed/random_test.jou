    # check that the biggest value is between 99% and 100% of RAND_MAX.

    # 10000 times is enough to be very sure that the biggest value is within 1%
    # of the maximum. If `rand()` produces perfectly random values, then the
    # probability of getting 10000 values in the top 1% is 0.99 ^ 10000. This
    # is a very small number. See https://github.com/Akuli/jou/issues/916 for
    # the math.
