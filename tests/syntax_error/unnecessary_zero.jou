    # Leading zeros are allowed in hex and binary numbers, because in those
    # numbers, the position is usually significant. Example:
    #
    #   FLAG_FOO = 0x01
    #   FLAG_BAR = 0x02
    #   FLAG_BAZ = 0x04
    #   FLAG_LOL = 0x10

    very_good_perms = 0777  # Error: unnecessary zero at start of number
