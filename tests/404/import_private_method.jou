import "./imported/privates.jou"

def foo() -> None:
    p = PublicClass{}
    # TODO: ideally error message would say that it exists but is private
    p.private_method()  # Error: method 'private_method' not found in class PublicClass. The problem is ONE of the following: 1) you didn't import the file that defines class PublicClass, 2) the 'private_method' method is private, 3) there really is no such method in class PublicClass. I know that this is a bad compiler error message, and I will later split this into 3 different error messages.
