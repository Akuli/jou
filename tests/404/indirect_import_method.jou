import "./imported/point_factory.jou"

def blah() -> int:
    p = make_point()
    # TODO: Improve this error!
    return p.get_sum()  # Error: method 'get_sum' not found in class Point. The problem is ONE of the following: 1) you didn't import the file that defines class Point, 2) the 'get_sum' method is private, 3) there really is no such method in class Point. I know that this is a bad compiler error message, and I will later split this into 3 different error messages.
