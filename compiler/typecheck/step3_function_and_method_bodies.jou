# The third and final step of type checking. Checks the code inside functions
# and methods.
#
# After the third step, local variables exist, and the types of all values in
# the program are known.
#
# This step assumes that all classes, enums, global variables and functions
# already exist and are fully populated, so that we e.g. know what methods each
# class has and what parameter types they take.
