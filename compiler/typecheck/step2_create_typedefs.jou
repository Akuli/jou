# Second step of type checking is to handle `typedef` statements, which create
# more names for existing types.
#
# After the first two steps, all types defined in Jou exist, but may not be
# ready, e.g. classes don't contain any members yet. This way, when later steps
# check function signatures, they can refer to classes that are defined
# anywhere in the project, e.g. later in the same file.
