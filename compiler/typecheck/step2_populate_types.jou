# Second step of type checking is to check function/method signatures, global
# variables, and bodies of classes. However, we don't look into function or
# method bodies yet, because they reference other functions and methods which
# might not exist.
#
# After the second step, all types, functions, and global variables are ready.
#
# This step assumes that all types exist, but doesn't need to know what fields
# and methods each class has.
