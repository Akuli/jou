# First step of type checking is to create types, so that they exist when later
# stages reference the types.
#
# After the first step, classes defined in Jou exist, but they are all opaque
# and contain no members. This way, when step 2 checks function signatures,
# they can refer to classes that are defined anywhere in the project, e.g.
# later in the same file.
#
# Enums are simple. The first step creates them and also fills in their members,
# although it doesn't really matter whether that's done in step 1 or 2.
