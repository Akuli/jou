  # The Jou repository includes a zipped copy of mingw64 that doesn't include some
  # large files unnecessary for developing Jou. People with slow internet need it.
  #
  # This check fails if the zip file contains anything else than what's in the original/full zip file.
  # It serves two purposes:
  #   * People can trust the random zip file I have created locally on my system and committed.
  #   * I can be sure that I didn't accidentally include something unnecessary or do something else dumb.
