New types:
- Type variable: the undetermined `T` of `List[T]`. Available when checking class bodies.

New export symbols:
- generic class, e.g. `List`

New stuff to FileTypes:
- generic class, e.g. `List`

When `List` becomes `List[int]`, we basically create a new class.
Name of new class is "List[int]".

New check in type checker: ensure we can compute the size of a given type.
Called for all local variables and intermediate values.
Base case: succeeds for pointers and numbers, fails for type variables.
Recursion: check class members
