New types:
- Type variable: the undetermined `T` of `List[T]`. Available when checking class bodies.
- Generic instance: `List[T]` or `List[byte]`

New check in type checker: ensure we can compute the size of a given type.
Called for all local variables and intermediate values.
Base case: succeeds for pointers and numbers, fails for type variables.
Recursion: check class members

Plain `List` is stored and exported as generic instance `List[T]`, where `T` is the type variable.
