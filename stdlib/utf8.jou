# Jou strings are always represented as UTF-8. Most of the time you can simply
# pass strings around and not worry about how UTF-8 works. But when you need
# something more, this file likely does what you need. For the rare cases when
# this file is not enough, please create an issue on GitHub.
#
# For example, this file can tell you that "ö" is one character, but it cannot
# tell you that the name of the character is "LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS".
