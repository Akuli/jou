# Functions for working with processes (i.e. running programs).
#
# Many functions apply to the current process. Some create new
# processes as subprocesses of the current process.

# Run a command in a new subprocess. Return value 0 means it succeeded.
declare system(command: byte*) -> int

# Exit the current process.
declare exit(status: int) -> void  # Clean exit (status: 0 = success, nonzero = fail)
declare abort() -> void  # Hard exit. Similar to a crash.
