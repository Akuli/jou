# Returns a random value between 0 and RAND_MAX inclusive.

# By default, the same values are returned every time the program runs.

# The random values are not cryptographically secure. This means that someone
# may be able to guess what the next random value is if they know something

declare rand() -> int

# The `rand()` function produces a sequence of numbers that depend on a number
# known as the seed. This function sets that seed.
#
# For example, you can use `srand(0)` to reset the state so that you get the same
# random values as when the program started, or `srand(1234)` to get a different
# sequence.
#
# A common (and often good enough) trick is to use the current time as the seed:
#
#   srand(time(NULL) as int32)
#
# Unfortunately Jou doesn't have the `time()` function in stdlib yet. Please
# create an issue if this is a problem for you.
